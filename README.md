# Client Management Application

This is a React-based client management application built with TypeScript, Material-UI, and React Router. It allows users to register, log in, view a list of clients, add new clients, edit existing clients, and delete clients.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Node.js:** (v14 or later recommended) Download and install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
*   **npm:** (Node Package Manager) Usually comes bundled with Node.js.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YoanRene/app-mantenimiento-clientes.git
    cd app-mantenimiento-clientes
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    This command installs all the necessary packages listed in the `package.json` file.


## Running the Application

1.  **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    This command starts the React development server, typically on `http://localhost:3000`.  The application will automatically reload in your browser whenever you make changes to the source code.
